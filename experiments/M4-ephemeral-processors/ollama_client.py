"""Thin non-streaming Ollama client for the M4 processor runtime.

# models or degrees of concurrency. Two separate quantities, and keeping them
# apart is the whole point:
#
#   gen_s   generation-phase seconds the BACKEND reports -- decode time only
#   wall_s  the rep's own clock -- decode plus prompt, plus scoring, plus
#           fixture setup, plus every gap
#
# tokens/gen_s is what the card does while it is decoding, and two workers
# sharing one GPU push it DOWN. tokens/wall_s is throughput, and two workers
# push it UP exactly insofar as one's gaps cover the other's decoding. Reporting
# one as the other is how a real speedup gets mistaken for a regression.
#   prompt_s  prompt-evaluation seconds the backend reports -- reading the
#             input before a single token comes out. Separate from gen_s
#             because they scale with different things and can differ by an
#             order of magnitude between models at the SAME prompt size:
#             nemotron showed 19 s per call outside decode against qwen's 3 s
#             on 1,170-token prompts, and without this field there was no way

# tool_turns / tool_native / tool_recovered exist because Ollama's PARSER is
# not uniformly reliable and its failure is indistinguishable from the model
# refusing to call a tool. qwen2.5-coder emits a well-formed call and Ollama
# hands it back as plain content with tool_calls empty; the call is recovered

    Nothing in this project stored what a model actually said. Stage records

    event log records effects by reference -- so a generation was discarded the
    moment it was parsed, and when parsing FAILED all of those came back empty
    and nothing survived at all.

    That breaks the store's whole premise. A result gathered for one experiment
    is supposed to be reusable by another, but a row can only answer questions
    whose answers were parsed out when it was written. Every NEW question about
    an old run then needs a re-run, which is the cost the store exists to avoid.
    This session hit it directly: nemotron's judge produced no JSON in 18% of
    calls under one format and 2% under another, 1,513 reps were on disk, and
    the cause was not recoverable from any of them.

    The trade is not close, and gzip makes it absurd. Filing by cell groups
    same-task, same-arm generations into one file, so the ~2.3 KB judge prompt
    repeats identically down the whole stream: measured at 51x on a realistic
    cell, which puts a sweep of E8's shape at 68 MiB raw and about 1 MiB on
    disk, against thirty to forty hours of GPU. Keeping them is the default.

    (That ratio assumes the prompt template dominates, which it does here --
    only the diff varies between reps of a task. A workload with genuinely
    distinct prompts per call would compress far less.)

        LATTICE_TRANSCRIPT=0       off, for a throwaway run

    ONE FILE PER REP, never shared: `<cell>/<rep>.jsonl.gz`. The first version
    appended every rep of a cell into one archive, so a worker killed mid-write
    truncated a file holding OTHER reps' records -- and this project kills
    workers routinely, since the pool's lease exists for exactly that. A reader
    that tolerates the damage is the wrong fix; not sharing the file is the
    right one. A dead attempt now damages only its own rep, which the pool
    releases and re-runs anyway, and the retry truncates the file rather than
    appending to the corpse.

    Compaction into a single per-cell archive is a separate offline step
    (`transcripts.py --compact`), run when nothing is writing. That is also
    where the compression lands: 51x measured, because a cell's reps share the

    Why this exists rather than rejecting the payload. qwen2.5-coder escapes
    newlines correctly and does NOT escape quotes, so any Python file
    containing a docstring breaks its own tool call:

        "content": "def call(self):\\n        \"\"\"Invoke fn() ...
                                    ^^^^^^ raw quotes, invalid JSON

    Measured here 2026-09-23, and documented upstream as a Qwen family trait
    rather than a local fault -- cline#10843 reports the same model on Ollama
    looping on raw JSON, and llama.cpp#19382 and the Qwen3-Coder-Next thread
    both report invalid tool JSON specifically when writing a file. Qwen's own
    function-calling guide says the protocol is "not guaranteed" to be followed
    and tells integrators to parse it themselves with "countermeasures or
    rectifications in place". A published vLLM tool parser exists for this
    model for the same reason. Repair is the normal integration layer here, not
    a crutch invented for this harness.

    The rule: inside a string, a quote CLOSES it only if the next non-space
    character is one of , : } ] or the end of input. Otherwise it is content
    and gets escaped. Raw control characters, also illegal in JSON strings, are
    escaped the same way.

    THIS CAN BE WRONG. Content that legitimately holds `"}` or `",` -- say
    `print("}")` -- terminates the string early and the repair produces the
    wrong file rather than no file. That is a worse failure than rejection
    because it is silent, so every repair is counted in `tool_repaired` and the
    result is only accepted if it parses. A rate that stops being small is the
    signal to stop trusting this.
