    parameter existed.

    Two different things were being conflated under one absent key.

    ARM-DEPENDENT text varies with the experiment -- the AUDIT and JUDGE
    prompts, the workflow's shape. `arm_sha` and `prompt_sha` already cover it,

    MODEL-DEPENDENT text varies with the adapter -- the output protocol, the
    tool schemas, the wire format of a tool result. It is IDENTICAL across
    every arm, and it changes when we point at a different model or fix a
    renderer quirk, not when we change the experiment. Folding it into
    `arm_sha` would make an adapter fix look like a new arm, which is the same
    conflation running the other way.

    So it gets its own hash, and it hashes the TEXT THE MODEL SEES rather than
    the file that produces it -- comments and docstrings move constantly and
    never reach the model, while a one-word change inside the protocol block
    changes everything and would not move a file hash any more than a typo fix
    in a comment does.

    exactly once to finish". That is an instruction, present in every tool-mode
    run, and under the old key it would have been invisible -- same cell id
