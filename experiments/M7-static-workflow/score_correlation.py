"""Does the judge track the check, or track the worker?

Every judge arm so far has been scored against the check. That says whether it is
right. It does not say **what it is a copy of**, and that is the question
`50-findings/11` finding 6 turns on: a judge holding the worker's context is predicted
to become a second sample of the worker rather than an independent reading.

The worker's own verdict is recorded on every run as a type-4 effect and is worthless
alone -- it says `answered` on 96% of tasks, +3 points over a constant. But as a
*reference series* it is exactly what a correlated judge would converge on.

So for each arm, three numbers over the same tasks:

    agreement with the CHECK     is it right?
    agreement with the WORKER    is it a copy of the worker?
    the gap between them         which one is it tracking?

A judge that is genuinely independent should sit above chance against the check and
near chance against the worker. One that has become a second sample should do the
reverse, and the diff-only arms give the baseline for how much of the agreement is
just both being usually correct on easy tasks.
