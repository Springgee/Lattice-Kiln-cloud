"""Derive m7d from m7c's record, without running it.

m7d is m7c with the judge admitted on the **direction condition**: it may only
restrict. `answered` requires the check to be complete AND the judge to say `met`; a
judge that disagrees turns `answered` into `blocked-partial` and can never produce a
success. A degraded judge yields unnecessary escalation, never a false pass
(`03-capability-authority-model.md`, the direction condition; `11-static-workflow.md`,
no lone model probe may flip a terminal state -- which this respects, since it
withholds a claim rather than making one).

**Why this is derivable and the alternative is not.** Here the verdict is read once,
after the loop, so it changes no candidate and the trajectory is identical to m7c's.
Replaying the terminal against the logged verdict gives exactly what a run would.

Wiring the judge into the *keeper* instead would change which candidate is kept, hence
the next round's starting state, hence everything after it. That trajectory cannot be
replayed from a log of a different one -- it needs a verdict per candidate, which
m7c never collected and cannot without running.
