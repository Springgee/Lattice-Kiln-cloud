"""Does a reviewer's objection in the objective trigger findings-6's failure mode?

findings-log entry 6 (M5): a 7B implementer **narrates instead of writing** -- no FILE
block, empty output -- whenever its context carries conversational text, and the three
cases it names are *a plan, a critique, a prior summary*. A judge's objection is a
critique, so this is the named case rather than an analogy.

Two things make it worth measuring rather than assuming.

**The M5 fix changed two things at once.** It removed the planner's prose AND moved
retry hints from a separate "additional input" block into the objective. Which of the
two mattered was never separated, so the evidence does not establish that prose *in
the objective* is harmful -- only that prose in a separate block was.

**The failure has a mechanical signature.** No FILE block means no type-1 effect, and
the recorder logs every effect. So "did the implementer stop writing?" is a count, not
a judgement.
