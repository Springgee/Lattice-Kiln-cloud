"""Score the judge against the check, on the two populations separately.

The traps were named in PREDICTION-M7C.md before the run and both are honoured here.

**Empty diffs are scored apart.** On an empty diff `not_met` is trivially right for any
task demanding work, and needs no judgement. If accuracy collapses once they are
removed, the judge is detecting emptiness -- which `len()` does for nothing.

**The base rate is shown beside every precision.** A constant "met" scores the task
pass rate. `score_self_report.py` found the worker sits +3 points above that, which is
the bar, and a raw precision above 80% can still be worthless.
