"""Score the worker's own verdict on its own work. Costs nothing: already recorded.

The implementer's control block is mandatory and carries
`terminal_state: answered | blocked | declined` plus a prose `summary`. The runtime
records it as a **type-4 work-record mutation**, which is what
`10-technical/01-effect-vocabulary.md` says a processor's own recorded conclusion is.

The workflow then **discards it** -- `_pass` calls the implementer without capturing
the result -- because no lone model probe may produce a terminal
(`11-static-workflow.md`).

But discarding it for decisions is not a reason to leave it unscored. **It is the
cheapest possible judge**: the worker already answers the question the independent
judge is being built to answer, at zero extra calls, on every run ever made.

**A judge has to beat this to be worth anything**, and nothing had checked what this
is worth.
