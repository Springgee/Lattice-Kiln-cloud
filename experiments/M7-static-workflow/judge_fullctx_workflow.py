"""judge-fullctx - a judge holding the same material the worker held.

Built to test a ruling that says it should not work. `50-findings/11` finding 6:
a judge given essentially the worker context is independent in the strict sense and
its judgement then measures the model noise rather than the work, because two
instances of one model over one context share their blind spots.

That is a prediction. This measures it.

The measurement is NOT agreement with the check -- every judge arm reports that. It
is agreement with the WORKER SELF-REPORT. If the extra context turns the judge into
a second sample of the worker, it converges on the worker verdict while the
diff-only judge does not. That convergence is the signature and it is observable.

Original keeper-strict header follows.

M7b - the static supervised workflow, variant 2.

R1..R5 from INVENTORY.md. Differences from `m7` are marked R1..R5 inline.
Prediction recorded in PREDICTION-M7B.md before the run.

Original header follows.

M7 - the static supervised workflow.

Specification: docs/10-technical/11-static-workflow.md

Four stages in fixed order; two always fire, two fire on condition.

  1. premise audit    always fires, ADVISORY ONLY - may never produce a terminal
  2. concern split    fires on condition
  3. implement        always fires
  4. test gate/keeper always fires - incumbent-protected, escalate on stall

Terminals are the processor contract's three: answered | declined | blocked.
Only the test gate and the escalation rule produce one; no model call does.

Built from the `dloop` core in M6's m6_arms.py, which is where the spine and the
keeper were measured. What is new here is stage 1 made advisory, stage 2 made
conditional, and the per-stage influence record that lets a stage be retired.
