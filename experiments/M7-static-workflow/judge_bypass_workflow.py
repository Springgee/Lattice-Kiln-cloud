"""judge-bypass - judge-anchored, but the judge is never asked the trivial question.

Operator ruling. The judge is skipped whenever the mechanical decline is about to
fire: the check was already satisfied before any work and nothing improved it.

**Not because the judge degrades those cases.** It does not -- the terminal there is
a pure function of the check, so no verdict can move it, and the measured cost is
about one call per task. The reason is methodological.

Those tasks are exactly the empty diffs on which the judge translates *nothing
changed* into *the request was doubtful* and lands right by accident. Removing them
from its workload means it is only ever asked the question that needs judging, so
**its number is honest by construction** rather than needing to be split into two
populations afterwards.

The condition is mechanical on purpose. Gating on *the request looks unsound* would
gate the judge on the premise audit, whose precision is around 20%
(`50-findings/10`, finding 6).

Original judge-anchored header follows.

M7f-derived: judge-anchored - m7f plus an EXPECTATION written before any work exists.

Operator ruling. m7c's judge failed on non-empty diffs by matching the diff's topic
to the request's topic -- "the diff adds a retries parameter ... which meets the
request" -- never asking whether the code works, because it cannot run anything. On
a suite whose largest stress tag is edge-coverage, the topical answer is always
obvious and never sufficient.

The diagnosis: the diff is handed to the judge as objective data when it is a
**claim** -- the worker's assertion that this is the answer. Judging a claim means
comparing it against something independent of whoever made it.

So stage 1, which already runs before any work and already sees the code, now also
emits `expected`: 2-5 observable conditions a finished change must exhibit. It
costs no extra call, and it cannot be contaminated by the worker because it is
written before the worker exists.

**The expectation is written by the same 7B and its quality is a thing to measure,
not to assume.** An expectation reading "the retry logic works" anchors nothing.

Original m7f header follows.

M7f - m7e with the judge oriented: it is told what produced its inputs.

m7c and m7e both hand the judge a request, a note and a diff with no account of
where any of it came from. It does not know a 7B produced the diff in a loop, that
an empty diff is ambiguous between "could not" and "correctly refused", or that the
note it is given has 18% precision (`50-findings/10`, finding 6).

This prompt supplies that orientation and five worked examples. The examples use
invented code, never the suite, since drawing them from the tasks under test would
contaminate the measurement. They are chosen to cover the situations the judge
cannot infer rather than one per verdict, which would anchor the distribution.

Original m7e header follows.

M7e - m7c with the judge writing an INSTRUCTION rather than a critique.

findings-log entry 6 names the trigger as conversational text in the context -- "a
plan, a critique, a prior summary" -- and the failure as narration instead of
writing. m7c hands the implementer an objection, which is a critique and therefore
the named case. Here the judge is instructed to produce one imperative sentence
naming the aspect still to be done, and it is folded in like the mechanical hint
beside it. Same information, different register.

That isolates the variable entry 6 never separated: whether the harm is model prose
as such, or prose in the wrong register and the wrong place.

Original m7c header follows.

M7c - m7b plus an independent judge, measured and given no authority.

R1..R5 as m7b, plus the judge below. See PREDICTION-M7C.md.

Original m7b header follows.

M7b - the static supervised workflow, variant 2.

R1..R5 from INVENTORY.md. Differences from `m7` are marked R1..R5 inline.
Prediction recorded in PREDICTION-M7B.md before the run.

Original header follows.

M7 - the static supervised workflow.

Specification: docs/10-technical/11-static-workflow.md

Four stages in fixed order; two always fire, two fire on condition.

  1. premise audit    always fires, ADVISORY ONLY - may never produce a terminal
  2. concern split    fires on condition
  3. implement        always fires
  4. test gate/keeper always fires - incumbent-protected, escalate on stall

Terminals are the processor contract's three: answered | declined | blocked.
Only the test gate and the escalation rule produce one; no model call does.

Built from the `dloop` core in M6's m6_arms.py, which is where the spine and the
keeper were measured. What is new here is stage 1 made advisory, stage 2 made
conditional, and the per-stage influence record that lets a stage be retired.

    `best["s"]["full"]` -- and the check is satisfied. Together these mean the
    terminal is `declined` whatever anyone says, so a verdict cannot move it.

    **But that is not enough to skip the judge, and skipping on those two alone was a
    serious mistake.** There are two reasons a check can be satisfied while nothing

      the request really had nothing to do -- the five false-premise tasks. The
      decline is right, the diff is empty, and a verdict here measures the judge's
      ability to notice emptiness rather than anything about the work.

      **or the check does not measure what was asked.** `wf3_refactor_blindview` is
      exactly this: the check the worker saw passes on untouched source, so the arm
      declines, and the decline is *measurably wrong* -- the recorded score says
      STRUCTSCORE 0/3. Here the check has said its piece and said "fine", and the
      only remaining question is whether it was asking the right question. **No
      mechanical thing can answer that, and the judge is the only instrument left.**
      Skipping it here removes the one case where it is not redundant with the check

    for whether to decline. Measured on the m7c run, that routing separated the
    subpopulation perfectly -- a concern on all five false premises, silence on both
    real-work tasks. That is 7 tasks in one run and it is the right measurement, since

did not write any of it and you have not seen their reasoning or any test output.

THE DIFF IS A CLAIM, NOT EVIDENCE. It is the engineer's assertion that this is the
answer. Do not read it and ask whether it looks like the right kind of change --
naming a parameter after the request, or importing a library the request implies, is
what a wrong change looks like too. **Take the conditions one at a time and ask, for
each, whether this code satisfies it.** A change can be entirely on-topic and satisfy
none of them.

AN EMPTY DIFF IS AMBIGUOUS AND YOU MUST DECIDE WHICH IT IS. Either the engineer could
not do the work -- "not_met" -- or they read the request, found it rested on something
false, and correctly refused -- "unsound_request". The diff cannot tell you which.
Only the request can. **Most empty diffs are "not_met".**

Answer with ONE JSON object and nothing else:
  "checked": one line per condition, in order, each "yes" or "no"
  "verdict": one of "met", "not_met", "unsound_request"
      met  - every condition is satisfied
  "instruction": ONE sentence, and only when the verdict is "not_met" -- name the
  first unsatisfied condition, in the imperative. Do not comment on the attempt.

--- EXAMPLE ---

REQUEST: Add a retries parameter to Client.call(fn, retries=2).
CONDITIONS:
  1. retries=0 makes exactly one attempt
  2. the LAST exception is re-raised when every attempt fails
DIFF: @@ def call(self, fn, retries=2): @@
      +        for i in range(retries):
      +            try: return fn()
      +            except Exception: pass
      +        return fn()
{"checked": ["no - range(retries) with retries=0 skips the loop, then fn() runs once,
so that one is satisfied", "no - the final fn() raises its own exception, which is not
kept from earlier attempts"], "verdict": "not_met", "instruction": "Re-raise the

    That absence is the independence being tested. `50-findings/07` measured a panel
    that shared the work's context and made a deterministic gate worse -- 9/10 alone,
    6/10 with the panel added. The hypothesis here is that sharing the context was the
