"""test-synth - keeper-strict, with the model asked to WRITE a witness rather than
judge one.

Operator question: can a 7B write a mechanical check more reliable than it can judge?
It is the counterpart to the result that a witness beats a judge wherever a witness
is writable, and it asks whether the model can supply the witness itself.

One property makes this different in kind: **the test is executed.** Misreading the
code stops mattering; what matters is whether the requirement can be expressed as
running code. A malformed witness fails loudly rather than returning a confident
wrong verdict, which is the worst mode a judge has.

The synthesised file has no authority and never touches the real workspace.

Original keeper-strict header follows.

M7b - the static supervised workflow, variant 2.

R1..R5 from INVENTORY.md. Differences from `m7` are marked R1..R5 inline.
Prediction recorded in PREDICTION-M7B.md before the run.

Original header follows.

M7 - the static supervised workflow.

Specification: docs/10-technical/11-static-workflow.md

Four stages in fixed order; two always fire, two fire on condition.

  1. premise audit    always fires, ADVISORY ONLY - may never produce a terminal
  2. concern split    fires on condition
  3. implement        always fires
  4. test gate/keeper always fires - incumbent-protected, escalate on stall

Terminals are the processor contract's three: answered | declined | blocked.
Only the test gate and the escalation rule produce one; no model call does.

Built from the `dloop` core in M6's m6_arms.py, which is where the spine and the
keeper were measured. What is new here is stage 1 made advisory, stage 2 made
conditional, and the per-stage influence record that lets a stage be retired.
