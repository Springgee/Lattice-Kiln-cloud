"""test-synth-retry - test-synth, with the witness allowed to fix its own file.

Operator: give it a second chance. The first run gave the witness ONE call and no
feedback, and 78 of its 93 execution failures read "no SYNTH line" -- the model wrote
a sensible test and printed its own format instead of the demanded one. That is
protocol non-compliance, the same failure entry 6 names, and it is the one class the
arm already repairs for its implementer.

THE RETRY FIRES ON EXECUTION FAILURE ONLY, never on the test being weak. Telling the
model its test passes on broken code says the test is wrong without saying why, and
the cheapest way to satisfy that is to tighten it arbitrarily -- teaching it to
satisfy the discriminator rather than to test the requirement. A traceback leaks
nothing about correctness.

So execution should rise and discrimination should NOT move. If discrimination moves,
something leaked and the measurement is spoiled rather than improved.

Original test-synth header follows.

test-synth - keeper-strict, with the model asked to WRITE a witness rather than
judge one.

Operator question: can a 7B write a mechanical check more reliable than it can judge?
It is the counterpart to the result that a witness beats a judge wherever a witness
is writable, and it asks whether the model can supply the witness itself.

One property makes this different in kind: **the test is executed.** Misreading the
code stops mattering; what matters is whether the requirement can be expressed as
running code. A malformed witness fails loudly rather than returning a confident
wrong verdict, which is the worst mode a judge has.

The synthesised file has no authority and never touches the real workspace.

Original keeper-strict header follows.

M7b - the static supervised workflow, variant 2.

R1..R5 from INVENTORY.md. Differences from `m7` are marked R1..R5 inline.
Prediction recorded in PREDICTION-M7B.md before the run.

Original header follows.

M7 - the static supervised workflow.

Specification: docs/10-technical/11-static-workflow.md

Four stages in fixed order; two always fire, two fire on condition.

  1. premise audit    always fires, ADVISORY ONLY - may never produce a terminal
  2. concern split    fires on condition
  3. implement        always fires
  4. test gate/keeper always fires - incumbent-protected, escalate on stall

Terminals are the processor contract's three: answered | declined | blocked.
Only the test gate and the escalation rule produce one; no model call does.

Built from the `dloop` core in M6's m6_arms.py, which is where the spine and the
keeper were measured. What is new here is stage 1 made advisory, stage 2 made
conditional, and the per-stage influence record that lets a stage be retired.
