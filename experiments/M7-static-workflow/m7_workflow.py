"""M7 - the static supervised workflow.

Specification: docs/10-technical/11-static-workflow.md

Four stages in fixed order; two always fire, two fire on condition.

  1. premise audit    always fires, ADVISORY ONLY - may never produce a terminal
  2. concern split    fires on condition
  3. implement        always fires
  4. test gate/keeper always fires - incumbent-protected, escalate on stall

Terminals are the processor contract's three: answered | declined | blocked.
Only the test gate and the escalation rule produce one; no model call does.

Built from the `dloop` core in M6's m6_arms.py, which is where the spine and the
keeper were measured. What is new here is stage 1 made advisory, stage 2 made
conditional, and the per-stage influence record that lets a stage be retired.
