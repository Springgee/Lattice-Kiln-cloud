"""E8: what changes when the judge states its reasons before its verdict.

    python analyse.py                 # all three measures, join self-validated
    python analyse.py --validate      # only the join's accuracy against truth
    python analyse.py --unresolved    # what could not be attributed, and why

Three measures, reported together because the first one alone misleads.

1. REJECTIONS OF CHECK-PASSING CANDIDATES (PROTOCOL.md's primary measure).
   A candidate whose deterministic check was already full (`check_full`) and
   whose verdict is nonetheless `not_met`. Rate over check-passing candidates,
   not over reps: a rep may put several candidates to the judge, and a format
   that changes how many survive to be judged would otherwise move the
   denominator for a reason unrelated to the verdict.

2. CORRECT CHOICE (added 2026-09-22). Measure 1 counts every `not_met` on
   check-passing work as a defect, and some rejections are right -- the
   deterministic check is not the whole truth, since structural dimensions are
   non-gating (E0 defect 1). So this asks the question measure 1 only appears
   to: per rep, did the judge's FINAL verdict match what was actually
   delivered?

       normal task        truth = objective_pass (gate AND every structural
                          dimension). Correct = `met` when true, `not_met`
                          when false.
       false-premise task the right call is to refuse the work outright, so
                          correct = `unsound_request`.

   It splits measure 1's single number into false rejection and false
   acceptance, which move in opposite directions under this variable and are
   not interchangeable.

3. THE EMPTY-DIFF SPLIT (added 2026-09-22, corrected same day). judge_caveat
   is the only arm whose JUDGE prompt carries a block about how to weigh the
   per-condition tokens, and that block names one case explicitly: an empty
   diff, where every condition reads "no" whether the engineer failed or
   correctly refused. Splitting on `diff_empty` tests whether the arm's effect
   lands where its prompt says it should.

   The first version of this split reported a rejection RATE and was therefore
   uninterpretable -- it did not say whether rejecting an empty diff is right.
   It is not one question but two, and they have opposite answers:

       decline_expected  the request was unsound and doing nothing was the
                         correct engineering move. `not_met` punishes a correct
                         refusal and is WRONG; `unsound_request` is right.
       otherwise         the check passes only because the baseline already
                         did. The conditions really are unmet, so `not_met` is
                         DEFENSIBLE.

   Pooled, the two look identical and a correct 100% sits beside a wrong 100%.
   Split, nemotron's empty-diff rejections turn out to be entirely the second
   kind and are not a failure at all, while qwen's are largely the first.

WHY THIS NEEDS A JOIN AT ALL
----------------------------
Verdicts live only in `M7-static-workflow/stage_influence_<arm>.jsonl`. That
path is fixed per arm and ignores LATTICE_RESULTS_SUBDIR, and until 2026-09-21
the record named neither the model nor the judge format. Every run of an arm
appended to one file, so E8 -- whose entire variable IS the judge format --
pooled its own measure. Records written after that date carry `model`,
`judge_format`, `results_subdir` and `t_end`, and are used directly. Earlier
ones are attributed by joining to the store.

THE JOIN, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS VERSION IS WORSE THAN USELESS
-----------------------------------------------------------
Key: (arm, task, rep, terminal) plus agreement on wall_s and call count.

The first version required wall_s to match EXACTLY and resolved 60% of records.
That was not merely weak, it was biased: the workflow times itself internally
while run_suite times the whole arm call, so the two differ by 0.0-0.3s almost
always, and exact matching discarded most true pairs. Worse, a key stays
ambiguous precisely when both formats produced the same terminal for the same
task and rep -- the agreement case -- so dropping unresolved records removed
evidence of the formats AGREEING and manufactured differences. It put
nemotron's judge_bypass at +22.7 points where the answer is +4.3.

A 0.5s tolerance plus call-count agreement fixes both, and `--validate` proves
it rather than asserting it: the records that carry real stamps have them held
back, and the join is asked to recover them. At 2026-09-22: 94.2% resolved, 0
wrong, 100.00% accurate among resolved.

That check runs on every invocation. The join is the only thing making the
older rows usable, and a change to the suite, the store or the workflows could
break it silently.

UNRESOLVED RECORDS ARE NOT A RESIDUAL
-------------------------------------
About a third of unstamped records do not resolve, far above the 5.8% seen on
stamped ones, because the file also holds runs from M7 experiments that predate
the store entirely. Those are correctly excluded. But the loss is uneven, and
one cell is destroyed by it: judge_anchored / qwen / decision_first resolves 9
reps out of 170 stored, because those rows were migrated from older M7 runs by
`seed_from_existing.py` and their stage records do not correspond. Cells under
the floors below are withheld rather than printed, because a rate on 31
candidates formats exactly like a rate on 400.
