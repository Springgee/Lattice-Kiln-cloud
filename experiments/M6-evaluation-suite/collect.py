"""Dense summary of every arm. Written to be read in a terminal without scrolling.

    python collect.py              # one line per arm
    python collect.py -j           # + judge block
    python collect.py -s           # + synthesised-witness funnel
    python collect.py -t TASK      # one task across every arm
    python collect.py -f           # flags only: what looks wrong

Columns: n=rows, R=reps, T=tasks, pass=mean objective_pass per rep (spread in
brackets), rg=regressions, dec=correct declines / expected, fd=false declines,
min=wall minutes, c/t=model calls per task.

**pass is a mean over reps and the bracket is the spread.** An arm varies by about
three tasks against itself at N=5, so two arms differing by less than that differ by
nothing (`50-findings/10`, finding 2). The bracket is there to stop the mean being
read as a point.

    `mean` was a mean over REP INDICES: for each i, how many tasks passed at
    their i-th rep. That silently drops a task from index i once it has fewer
    than i+1 reps, so a cell with uneven coverage reports later indices over a
    shrinking task set. Row-weighting has the same disease in the other
    direction -- a ten-rep task outvoting a one-rep task.

    Both are replaced by the rule in `evalkit/scoring.py`: average within a
    task, then over tasks, so every task counts once. `lo` and `hi` stay as the
    per-rep-index spread, which is still the honest way to show run-to-run
    variation, and `uneven` now says when the two disagree.
