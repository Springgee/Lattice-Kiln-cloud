"""An experiment declares the cells it needs; the planner says what to run.

    needed - have = run

A declaration names arms, model configurations, judge formats, a task set and a
target rep count. The planner resolves each combination against the **current**
environment -- the arm sources as they are now, the suite version as it is now --
and asks the store what it already holds.

That resolution is the point. If an arm was edited, its `arm_sha` moves, the
resolved cell is a different cell, and prior rows correctly stop matching. The
alternative, which this replaces, was to notice the edit by hand or not at all.

Because a bare "no match" is useless, the planner also reports **near misses**:
store cells differing from a needed cell in exactly one field. That is the
difference between "you have no data" and "you have this data at a different
arm_sha, and here are both hashes" -- which is what a waiver is written against.
