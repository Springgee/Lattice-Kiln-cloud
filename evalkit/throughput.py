"""Generated tokens per minute over a suite, and what a second worker does to it.

    python throughput.py                      # everything the store has timed
    python throughput.py --model qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q4_K_M
    python throughput.py --arm judge_bypass --since "2026-09-20 14:05"

Two rates, and confusing them is how a real speedup gets read as a regression:

  decode    tokens / gen_s   -- what the card does while it is decoding, summed
                                over streams. Two workers sharing one GPU split
                                its decode capacity, so PER STREAM this falls.
  suite     tokens / minute  -- tokens over wall clock, the union of the
                                intervals actually worked. This is the number
                                that says whether the sweep finishes sooner.

A rep is not decoding for most of its wall time: it sets up a fixture, scores a
baseline, runs an arm that may call the model several times with Python between
the calls, restores protected files and scores again. Those gaps are why a
second worker can help at all -- it decodes while the first one is scoring. The
gap fraction below is how much room there was for that to happen.

Concurrency is read off the rows rather than declared. Each rep records the
process that ran it and its wall interval; a rep is at concurrency N when N
distinct runners' intervals overlap it. So a pool worked by one worker and then
by two produces both buckets with no experiment design, and the comparison is
between real reps rather than a benchmark standing in for them.

Reps recorded before the meter existed carry no `gen_tok` and are skipped, with
a count reported so a thin table is never mistaken for a slow one.
