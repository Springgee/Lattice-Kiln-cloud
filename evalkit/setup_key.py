"""What produced a row, recorded well enough to decide reuse from data.

A result is only reusable by another experiment if it came from the same setup.
Until 2026-09-19 that question was answered by hand every time -- reading
directory names, diffing arm files against their git history, and remembering
which sweep used which model. The seeder for E8 green-lit stale rows because
the directory name said nothing about the fixture version, which is the failure
this module removes.

A **Cell** is everything that can change an outcome except the draw itself.
Reps are draws from a cell, so `rep` is not part of cell identity.

    fixture_sha     this task's fixture files, hashed (NOT the suite version:
                    a suite bump that touched two tasks must not invalidate
                    the other thirty-two)
    task            which task
    arm             which pipeline
    arm_sha         sha256 of the arm's source file
    prompt_sha      sha256 of the effective prompts that arm will send
    backend         ollama | llamacpp
    model           the model tag
    params          the EFFECTIVE generation settings. A default expands to
                    the concrete value it had, so a cell is always a complete
                    statement of what ran -- never "whatever the default was
                    that week".

A cell is a fact; a declaration is a query, and only the query may be vague.
A declaration may give a param the value `"any"`, which means two different
things on the two sides:

    running   -> use the ambient default, and record the concrete result
    matching  -> accept a stored row whatever value it has there

That is what keeps num_ctx honest without making it tyrannical. An experiment
that does not care writes `"num_ctx": "any"` and reuses rows recorded at 16384
and at 8192 alike; one that does care states a value and gets exactly it. The
difference is declared by the experiment rather than guessed by the key.
    judge_format    decision_first | reason_first
    params.protocol tools | markers -- how the model is asked to hand back its
                    work. Findings 15 showed the marker protocol is itself a
                    cause of failure on some models, so it is a variable and
                    belongs in the key. Rows recorded before it existed are
                    read as "markers", which is what they were.

`model_digest` is recorded but is NOT part of identity, for a reason worth
stating: legacy rows have no digest, so requiring one would block every reuse of
everything recorded before today. The rule instead is **known-different blocks,
unknown abstains** -- two cells whose digests are both known and differ never
match; a cell whose digest is unknown carries no opinion, and `provenance` says
so, so an experiment that wants the stricter rule can demand it.

`arm_sha` IS part of identity, and deliberately strict. Today's format hook
changed all three judge arms without changing their `decision_first` behaviour,
and I established that by diffing. Under this module that reuse is refused by
default and requires an explicit waiver naming both hashes and the reason --
which makes the judgement a recorded artifact instead of a claim in a commit
message.
