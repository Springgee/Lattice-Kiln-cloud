"""Read the raw generations a run produced, addressed by cell and rep.

    python transcripts.py                        # what is stored, and how big
    python transcripts.py <cell_id>              # every record for that cell

The store answers what a run scored. This answers what the model actually said,
which is the question every surprising result starts with and which nothing in
this project kept until 2026-09-22. `50-findings/14` was written with a judge
failing to emit JSON in 18% of calls under one format and 2% under another, and
1,513 reps on disk that could not say why.

ONE FILE PER REP, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------
Layout: `evalkit_store/transcripts/<cell_id>/<rep>.jsonl.gz`.

The first version appended every rep of a cell into one archive. That put a
worker's crash into a file holding OTHER reps' records, and this project kills
workers routinely -- the pool's lease exists for precisely that, and three
workers ran the last sweep. The reader grew a tolerance for truncated tails,
which is treating the symptom: a run that cannot be trusted to finish must not
be allowed to write where another run's results live.

With one file per rep:

  * a killed attempt damages only its own rep, which the pool releases and
    re-runs anyway, so the damage is to data that was about to be replaced;
  * the retry opens with "wt" and truncates, so it never appends to the corpse
    of the attempt before it;
  * no two processes ever hold the same file, so there is no interleaving to
    reason about and no lock to get wrong.

`run_suite` closes the file when the rep's row is committed, so a complete file
means a complete rep.

COMPACTION IS A SEPARATE, OFFLINE STEP
--------------------------------------
Per-rep files compress worse than one archive per cell, because a cell's reps
share a prompt template and gzip can only exploit that within a file. `--compact`
merges a cell's finished reps into `<cell_id>.jsonl.gz` and removes the parts,
which is where the 51x measured ratio lands.

It is deliberately NOT done by the workers. Two workers can hold different reps
of the same cell at once, so having them merge into a shared archive would
reintroduce exactly the shared-writer problem this layout exists to remove.
Run it when nothing is writing. It is idempotent and safe to interrupt: the
merged archive is written to a temporary file and moved into place, and the
parts are removed only afterwards.
